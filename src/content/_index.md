# About me

I'm Mathieu Schetienne, an engineer and developer interested in biotechnologies and
neuroscience.

I enjoy contributing to open-source softwares and promoting science through the
[scientific python organization](https://scientific-python.org/). In 2023, I joined
the steering council of [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools), the largest M/EEG data
analysis ecosystem in Python.

Currently, I work as a research engineer on the M/EEG platform of the
[Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva](https://hnp.fcbg.ch/). I advise researcher on all
technical aspects and share my expertise to promote high-quality research on our
platform.

Previously, I worked at [ONWARD](https://www.onwd.com/), developing the neuromodulation
algorithm used by the implantable spinal cord pulse generator in their lower limb
movement therapy.
