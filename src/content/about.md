I'm Mathieu, an engineer and developer with a passion for biotechnologies and neuroscience. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and helping promote science through the [scientific python organization](https://scientific-python.org/). Since 2023, I’ve joined the maintainer team of [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools), the largest Python ecosystem for M/EEG data analysis.

Currently, I’m a Senior Developer Engineer at [Dandelion Science](https://www.dandelion.science), where I help build the world’s first generative neuromodulation platform for brain treatment.

Previously, I worked as a research engineer on the M/EEG platform at the [Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva](https://fcbg.ch/), advising researchers on technical matters and sharing my expertise to foster rigorous, high-quality research. Before that, I was part of a clinical study at the [Medical Image Processing Lab (MIP:Lab)](https://miplab.epfl.ch/) and the [Wyss Center](https://wysscenter.ch/) that investigated whether neurofeedback could alleviate tinnitus. This study compared the gold-standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with both fMRI and EEG neurofeedback.

Earlier in my career, I worked at [ONWARD](https://www.onwd.com/), where I designed the neuromodulation algorithm used by an implantable spinal cord pulse generator in the lower limb movement therapy.
