# Neuroscience open-source projects

At the bridge between my employment by the M/EEG platform of the
[Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva](https://hnp.fcbg.ch/) and my enthusiasm for the
open-source scientific python community, I joined the [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools)
steering council and contributed to several packages in its ecosystem, all used in
behavioral and neuroscience research.
