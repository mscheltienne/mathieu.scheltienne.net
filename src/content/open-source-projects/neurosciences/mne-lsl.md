MNE-LSL provides a real-time brain signal streaming framework tightly integrated with
[MNE-Python](https://mne.tools). It provides a new python binding for the Lab Stremaing
Layer C++ library, interface widely adopted by EEG manufacturers to stream acquisition
data in real-time.

I took over [NeuroDecode](https://github.com/dbdq/neurodecode), a project initially
developed by the [Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva](https://hnp.fcbg.ch/) and transformed
it into a software benefitting from the robust and well-used
[MNE-Python](https://mne.tools) API. The project was rebranded into `MNE-LSL` and joined
the MNE ecosystem in October 2023.
