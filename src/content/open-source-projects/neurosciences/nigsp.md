NiGSP is a python library to run Graph Signal Processing on multimodal MRI data,
developed by the [Medical Image Processing Lab (NIP:Lab)](https://miplab.epfl.ch/)
headed by [Prof. Dimitri Van De Ville](https://miplab.epfl.ch/index.php/people/vandeville).

After working for 2 years in this amazing lab, I contributed to NiGSP to improve the
unit testing, CI infrastructure, documentation build and overall code quality. The
project was originaly devleoped by [Stefano Moia](https://github.com/smoia)
(github handle: [@smoia](https://github.com/smoia)).
