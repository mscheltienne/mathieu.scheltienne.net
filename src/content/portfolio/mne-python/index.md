MNE-Python is one of the 4 major M/EEG analysis package, alongside its 3 MATLAB
counterpart, [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/),
[Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction) and
[EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php). After using and contributing for
several years, I joined the steering community in March 2023.
