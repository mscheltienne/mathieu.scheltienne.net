Pycrostates provides EEG microstates analysis tightly integrated with
[MNE-Python](https://mne.tools) and opens the door for microstates analysis applied to
other sensor types, for instance MEG magnetometers and gradiometers.

The project was developed in collaboration with
[Victor FÃ©rat](https://vferat.github.io/)
(github handle: [@vferat](https://github.com/vferat)).
